        <p class="omelettes__1p">In 1830 Belgium became independent from the Netherlands and I became king. However, the
          dissatisfaction of
          the
          Netherlands with this had quite an impact on our economy. They closed off the canal connections to the
          northern
          provinces and even blockaded the harbour in Antwerp. We needed to find a solution if we were to become a
          strong
          industrial country: either to dig a new canal or to develop a railway network.</p>

        <h3 class="omelettes__qoutes">Personally I favoured the latter!</h3>

        <p class="omelettes__2p">Not everyone was in agreement, however. Between 1830 and 1834 there were a great number
          of discussions in
          parliament and lots of studies were carried out. Those opposing the railway claimed that there would be less
          employment opportunities, especially for the many coachmen and skippers. </p>

        <p class="omelettes__3p">Some even thought that the eggs would arrive like omelettes and the milk like butter! A clear sign of fear of
          the unknown.</p>

        <p class="omelettes__end">Anyway, in the end, the railway won. The engineers Pierre Simons and Gustave De Ridder
          were employed to
          create
          plans for the new railway. They even went to England to see how it was done there.</p>

        <h2>Let's roll</h2>
        <p class="roll__intro">Finally, on May 5, 1835, the moment arrived. Belgium was the first country on the European continent to open
          a
          public railway and I had the honour of inaugurating it. Brussels was the first capital in the world to have a
          rail connection: a 22 kilometre long railway line to Mechelen.</p>
<div class="roll__trees">
        <p>It was quite a spectacle: throngs of spectators showed up. They sat in trees and on roofs, there wasn't any
          space left. You couldn't begin to describe just how excited the crowd was: it was as if they could feel that a
          new era was about to begin.</p>

        <p class="roll__names">3 giants: La Flèche (the arrow), the Stephenson and L'Eléphant (the elephant)</p>

        <p class="roll__text">That day 900 guests travelled from Brussels-Allée Verte to Mechelen. The convoy consisted of three trains,
          each
          pulled by a fabulous new steam engine: La Flèche, the Stephenson and L'Eléphant. Passengers were seated in 30
          carriages, adorned with the national tricolour flag. There were simple open and covered bench wagons. But some
          more luxurious carriages for the important guests.</p>

        <p class="roll__text">The locomotives were like mysterious monsters. They were loud and had high chimneys from which smoke poured
          out
          continuously. On an open platform with a railing stood the driver. As he was standing there proudly, he truly
          seemed to tame the monster.</p>

        <p class="roll__text">Although the train could reach speeds of 60 km per hour it was driven more slowly in the beginning, so as to
          make everyone feel at ease. This despite the fact that there were positive reports of the first test drives at
          full speed:</p>

        <p class="roll__text">“We have to point out that this new method of transport does not affect the breathing. People are not at all
          suffering any discomfort in the open wagons.“</p>
